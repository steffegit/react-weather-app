### In this project i learned about:
- Fetching data from api
- More flexbox and transitions
- Backdrop-filter for a background-blur / Mica effect

### I wish I:
- Made a better design
- Maybe added some more animations

### Came back to the project in 2022:
- I did make a better design
- Unfortunately no animations
- Better written code
- LocalStorage usage
- Responsive design
